first things first
how to verify correctness of parsing process, when it comes to syntax everything is fine but in terms of logical analysis i did not provide any check.

checks for correctness what is available now.

error("Cannot convert string to int")
[] -> dycha nowa = "diawjdiajw woakdoa"; -> wrong data type passed
error("Warning implicit conversion from float to int")
[] -> dycha nowa = 12.2;
[] -> usage of identifier that has not been declared
[] -> usage of variable identifier as function call
[] ->
[] ->
[] ->


first idea -> some kind of table for storing the identifiers with proper information attached
